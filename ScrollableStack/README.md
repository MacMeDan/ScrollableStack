### ScrollableStack

The Scrollable Stack is inspired by the fact that StackViews are awesome and if a screen is too small they should be Scrollable. Auto Layout can be quite an ordeal to figure out and stackview make this realitivly simple. 

Using a Stack View can save a lot of boilerplate auto layout code but there are times when you might wish that it acted more like a table view and scrolled its contents. This gives you the ability to to adjust to any size screen without scrificing your contents design.
